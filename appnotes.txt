helloWorld.js is the javascript file that webpack spits out after it runs its config file

npm run-script dev-server starts the webpack (see package.json)

Intro
- donut with my parts
- fancy animation flip to bar graph
- click donut to expand to a sunburst. (wil have to have arcs drawn with no height basically)
- donut --> sunburst extended view to break apart categories
- can click on legend corr. to innermost arcs to add or delete them
- colors are by innermost arc category (ie slices are all shades of blue, purple, green etc depending on color of innermost arc category)
- in center of donut is my name?
- bg is eggshell, colors are from d3 interpolate b g maybe add purple (customize it or something) start with kibana colors because theyre pretty
- vertical legend stays statically located on the right

Eventually have: portfolio with more, maybe also a blog section and a photo section
For now: links to github, linkedin, contact and resume

assets
- need d3 chromatic and d3 interpolate
- font awesome
- see caravel for how to modularly include d3? *jk include d3 with import
- bootstrap for the column layout to contain the svg, col 2 - col 8 - col2 (or 3 6 3)
- top bar, mid row and footer components (pretty much it)

COMPONENTS:f
Top Bar
Mid Row
Footer

- need to add flex svg container
- top and footer are static, i would maybe create a component for each of them eventually but for now leave it
- make sure you're following correct practices like linting with react (functional components)

web pack config is only resolving from helloworld.jsx and not the components, it gets confused.
- data set: array of categories and count/100 with inner categories

- for polyfills will need to add it with ab undler at the end when its bundling...
